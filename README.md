# TCP Chat Application
This application was made as an introduction to .NET and WinForms, purely for education purposes. 
This application is multithreaded allowing for connections from multiple clients. I also have plans
to port this application to be able to run on Mac and Linux. My goal for this application is to host
the tcp server on my Raspberry Pi and be able to run the client from any machine on the same network to connect 
and chat with other people on the same network.
